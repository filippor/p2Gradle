/**
 * The <code>ProgressMonitor</code> interface is implemented by objects that monitor the progress of an activity; the
 * methods in this interface are invoked by code that performs the activity.
 * <p>
 * All activity is broken down into a linear sequence of tasks against which progress is reported. When a task begins, a
 * <code>beginTask(String, int)
 * </code> notification is reported, followed by any number and mixture of progress reports (<code>worked()</code>) and
 * subtask notifications (<code>subTask(String)</code>). When the task is eventually completed, a <code>done()</code>
 * notification is reported. After the <code>done()</code> notification, the progress monitor cannot be reused; i.e.,
 * <code>
 * beginTask(String, int)</code> cannot be called again after the call to <code>done()</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A request to cancel an operation can be signaled using the <code>setCanceled</code> method. Operations taking a
 * progress monitor are expected to poll the monitor (using <code>isCanceled</code>) periodically and abort at their
 * earliest convenience. Operation can however choose to ignore cancelation requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since notification is synchronous with the activity itself, the listener should provide a fast and robust
 * implementation. If the handling of notifications would involve blocking operations, or operations which might throw
 * uncaught exceptions, the notifications should be queued, and the actual processing deferred (or perhaps delegated to
 * a separate thread).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>CALLER/CALLEE RESPONSIBILITIES:</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Methods that receive an {@link ProgressMonitor} ("callees") must either obey the following conventions or include
 * JavaDoc explaining how it differs from these rules. The called method:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Will call {@link #beginTask} on the argument 0 or 1 times, at its option.</li>
 * <li>Will not promise to invoke {@link #done()} on the monitor.</li>
 * <li>Will not call {@link #setCanceled} on the monitor.</li>
 * <li>May rely on the monitor not being null.</li>
 * <li>May rely on the monitor ignoring the string passed to {@link #beginTask}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The caller:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Will either pass in a fresh instance of {@link ProgressMonitor} that has not had {@link #beginTask} invoked on
 * it yet, or will select an implementation of {@link ProgressMonitor} that explicitly permits multiple calls to
 * {@link #beginTask}.</li>
 * <li>Will not rely on the callee to invoke {@link #done()} on the monitor. It must either select an implementation of
 * {@link ProgressMonitor} that does not require {@link #done()} to be called, for example {@link SubMonitor}, or it
 * must invoke {@link #done()} itself after the method returns.</li>
 * <li>Will not pass in a null monitor unless the JavaDoc of the callee says that it accepts null.</li>
 * <li>Will pass in a monitor that ignores the name argument to {@link #beginTask} unless the JavaDoc for the callee
 * states otherwise.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The responsibilities described above were introduced in Eclipse 4.7 (Oxygen). Prior to Eclipse 4.7, it was common
 * practice for the callee to invoke {@link #done()} on its monitor and for the caller to rely upon this fact. As of
 * Eclipse 4.6, all the important top-level entry points have been updated to call {@link #done()}, meaning they work
 * with both methods that invoke {@link #done()} and methods that don't.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since this convention was introduced in Eclipse 4.7, some plugin code may need to change. In particular, callers that
 * pass a monitor are no longer allowed to rely upon the callee invoking {@link #done()} and must do so themselves if
 * necessary.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface can be used without OSGi running.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
